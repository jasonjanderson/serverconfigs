# =============================================================================================================== #

### MACHINE NAME ###
# SINGLE HOST #
#   Hostname, FQDN, or IP Address
#   Wildcards (*) can be used in FQDNs.

# NETGROUPS #
#   @<GROUP> from /etc/netgroups

# IP NETWORKS #
#   <IP>/<NETMASK>
#   EXAMPLE: 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0, 192.168.1.0/24

### SEC ###
# "sec=" option can be used in <GLOBAL OPTIONS> and/or <OPTIONS>
# The order of the "sec=" option with respect to other options does not matter.
# Options are colon (:) seperated and are evaluated in the order they appear.

# SECURITY FLAVORS #
# sys
#   default
#   no crypto‐graphic security

# krb5
#   authentication only

# krb5i
#   integrity protection

# krb5p
#   privacy protection

### OPTIONS ###
# secure #
#   Requires requests to originate on an internet port less than 1024
#   DEFAULT: On

# rw
#   Allow both read and write requests on the NFS volume.
#   DEFAULT: Off

# async
#   Allows the NFS server to reply to requests before any changes are committed to storage.
#   Improves performance, but could cause data corruption if server uncleanly restarts.
#   DEFAULT: Off

# sync
#   Replies to requests only after the changes have been committed to storage.
#   DEFAULT: On

# wdelay
#   Allows multiple related writes to be cached temporarly and written in one operation.
#   Improves performance when larger requests are used. Slower performance if small requests are used.
#   Has no effect if async is also set.
#   DEFAULT: On

# no_wdelay
#   Doesn't allow multiple related writes to be cached temporarly.
#   Improves performance when smaller requests are used. Slower performance if larger requests are used.
#   DEFAULT: Off

# hide
#   Causes nested shares to show up as empty directories instead of showing the contents of the share.
#   Set on the nested share.
#   DEFAULT: On

# nohide
#   Causes nested shares to show up in the parent mount instead of an empty directory showing up for the mount.
#   Only works on single host exports.
#   Set on the nested share.
#   DEFAULT: Off

# crossmnt
#   Causes nested shares to show up in the parent mount instead of an empty directory showing up for the mount.
#   Set on the parent share.

# subtree_check
#   Make sure that every file requested is in an exported subdirectory. When disabled (no_subtree_check),
#   the only verification is if the file is in an exported filesystem.
#   DEFAULT: Off

# no_subtree_check
#   Doesn't verify that every file requested is in an exported subdirectory. When enabled, the only
#   verification is if the file is in an exported filesystem.
#   DEFAULT: On

# auth_nlm
#   Requires authentication for NLM file locking requests. Requires a lock request to hold a credential
#   for a user who has access to a the file.
#   DEFAULT: On

# no_auth_nlm
#   Doesn't require authentication for NLM file locking requests. Does not require a lock request to hold
#   a credential for access to a the file.
#   DEFAULT: On

# no_auth_nlm
#   Authenticaion is NOT required for NLM locking requests. Normally the server requires
#   a lock request ot hold a credential for a user who has read access on the file, wit
#   DEFAULT: Off

# no_acl
#   Disable ACLs in filesystems that support ACLs.
#   DEFAULT: Off

# mp
#   Only allows the directory to be exported if it has been mounted sucessfully. If no mount point is given,
#   the export point must point to a mountpoint.

# fsid=num | root | uuid
#   The unique identifier to use for the file system being exported.
#   num: A user defined unique number.
#   root: Distinguished filesystem of the root.
#   uuid: Use the UUID of the filesystem.
#   DEFAULT: uuid

# refer=<PATH>@<HOST>...
#   Refers the client to a list of alternative locations for the filesystem.

# replicas=<PATH>@<HOST>...
#   If the client asks for alternative export points, it will be given this list of alternatives.

# root_squash
#   Requests from root(0:0) are not requested as such. They are requested using the UID/GID of 
#   the anonymous (nobody) user.
#   DEFAULT: On

# no_root_squash
#   Requests from root (0:0) are requested as root.
#   DEFAULT: Off

# all_squash
#   All requests from all UIDs and GIDs are requested as the anonoymous (nobody) user.

# no_all_squash
#   All requests from all UIDs and GIDs are requested as their respective UIDs and GIDs.

# anonuid=<UID>
#   The anonoymous UID to use when squashing.
#   DEFAULT: 65534

# anongid=<GID>
#   The anonoymous GID to use when squashing.
#   DEFAULT: 65534

# sample /etc/exports file
/               master(rw) trusty(rw,no_root_squash)
/projects       proj*.local.domain(rw)
/usr            *.local.domain(ro) @trusted(rw)
/home/joe       pc001(rw,all_squash,anonuid=150,anongid=100)
/pub            (ro,insecure,all_squash)
/srv/www        -sync,rw server @trusted @external(ro)

The  first  line  exports  the entire filesystem to machines master and
trusty.  In addition to write access, all uid squashing is  turned  off
for  host trusty. The second and third entry show examples for wildcard
hostnames and netgroups (this is the entry ‘@trusted’). The fourth line
shows  the  entry for the PC/NFS client discussed above. Line 5 exports
the public FTP directory to every host  in  the  world,  executing  all
requests  under  the  nobody account. The insecure option in this entry
also allows clients with NFS implementations that don’t use a  reserved
port  for  NFS.   The  sixth line exports a directory read-write to the
machine ’server’ as well as the ‘@trusted’ netgroup, and  read-only  to
netgroup  ‘@external’, all three mounts with the ‘sync’ option enabled.
